You are given a function,
int findCount(int arr[], int length, int num, int diff);

The function accepts an integer array ‘arr’, its length and two integer variables ‘num’ and ‘diff’. Implement this function to find and return the number of elements of ‘arr’ having an absolute difference of less than or equal to ‘diff’ with ‘num’.
Note: In case there is no element in ‘arr’ whose absolute difference with ‘num’ is less than or equal to ‘diff’, return -1.

Example:
Input:

arr: 12 3 14 56 77 13
num: 13
diff: 2
Output:
3

Explanation:
Elements of ‘arr’ having absolute difference of less than or equal to ‘diff’ i.e. 2 with ‘num’ i.e. 13 are 12, 13 and 14.


The function to execute is
ChatFrequentcharacter(Char str, char x)

This function has a string and a character. This function requires replacing the most used character in the str with the ‘x’ character.

Note: If two characters have the same frequency, then we will have to consider the frequency which has the lower ASCII value.

Example

Input:
str: bbadbbababb
char x: t

Output:
ttadttatatt

Explanation
The maximum character repeated is ‘b’ that is replaced with ‘t’
